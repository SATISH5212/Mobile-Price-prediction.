Mobile Price Prediction Project Readme

Introduction
The Mobile Price Prediction project is a machine learning-based application that aims to predict the price of a mobile device based on its features and specifications. This project utilizes a dataset of mobile devices with corresponding prices and various attributes, which is used to train a machine learning model for prediction.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project is collected from various sources and contains the following features:

Battery Power: The battery power of the mobile device (in mAh).
Blue: Bluetooth support (0 for no, 1 for yes).
Clock Speed: The clock speed of the mobile device's processor (in GHz).
Dual Sim: Dual SIM support (0 for no, 1 for yes).
Front Camera: The megapixels of the front camera.
Four G: 4G support (0 for no, 1 for yes).
Internal Memory: The internal storage of the mobile device (in GB).
Mobile Depth: The thickness of the mobile device (in mm).
Mobile Weight: The weight of the mobile device (in grams).
Number of Cores: The number of processor cores.
Primary Camera: The megapixels of the primary camera.
Pixel Resolution Height: The pixel resolution height of the screen.
Pixel Resolution Width: The pixel resolution width of the screen.
Ram: The RAM capacity of the mobile device (in GB).
Screen Height: The height of the mobile device's screen (in cm).
Screen Width: The width of the mobile device's screen (in cm).
Talk Time: The talk time of the mobile device (in hours).
Three G: 3G support (0 for no, 1 for yes).
Touch Screen: Touch screen support (0 for no, 1 for yes).
Wi-Fi: Wi-Fi support (0 for no, 1 for yes).
Requirements
Python 3.x
NumPy
Pandas
Scikit-learn
Jupyter Notebook (optional, for running the provided notebooks)
Model Training
To train the Mobile Price Prediction model, follow these steps:

Clone this repository to your local machine or download the files.
Ensure you have all the required dependencies installed using pip install -r requirements.txt.
Open the Jupyter Notebook Mobile_Price_Prediction_Model_Training.ipynb.
Follow the instructions in the notebook to preprocess the data and train the machine learning model.
Prediction
After training the model, you can use it to make price predictions for new mobile devices. To do so, follow these steps:

Prepare a CSV file containing the attributes of the mobile device for which you want to predict the price. Ensure that the CSV file has the same columns as the dataset used for training.
Load the trained model using the provided load_model() function.
Use the model's predict() function to get the price prediction for the new mobile device attributes.
